            <img src="img/logorestaurant.jpg" alt="">
            <p>My job was to create a logo for a Brooklyn Restaurant. The title for the logo can be named as The Brooklyn Plate or Culinary Intelligence. To let my viewer see the logo in one page I had to use layer comps to make my task be completed a lot more easier. The restaurant is going to serve junk food so on my first logo I decided to add a burger and fries to let my audience know what type of food they're serving. As for the second logo I used the most fancy and readable font. The third logo called Culinary Intelligence is shaped like a plate.<br><br> </p>

            <img src="img/pattern.jpg" alt="">
            <p>For this task, I had to change each person outfit into a crazy looking pattern. This assignment was like a little push for me to become a professional designer. This pattern was inspired by christmas sweater.</p>

            <img src="img/colorwheel.jpg" alt="">
            <p>My own personalized color wheel is about Pokemon characters. The task is to change the color of every different character with the same color on the color wheel chart. Then I add a layer mask so I know for sure that the Pokemons looks exactly the color on the chart. I used adjustment layers for everyone of them,which is really helpful because it's non-destructive. The most difficult part of this task is time, I needed more time to make it look perfect.</p>

            <p>In this project, I chosen two greatest designer named Paul Rand and Bradbury Thompson to inspire me to create a theme of both designer.I used the style of both designers to represent the poster above.</p>

            <p>The ACE movement is a program in my school and their goal is the spread kindness.This was my first time using a drawing-tablet, which was difficult to use at first, but I'm starting to imoprove. </p>

            <img src="img/speakout.jpg" alt="">
            <p>  I design a poster for SPARK's Speak Workshops and activities about some of the topics students most need and want to talk about: Substance Abuse, Teen Dating Violence, Cyberbullying, LGBTQ, etc. The challenge was to fit all the information in one page without making the page look too busy.<br><br></p>

          <a href="img/magazine.jpg">
            <img src="img/magazine.jpg" alt="">
            <p>My job is to make the hottest magazine to come up a brand new cover.The main theme is about selling make-up product and the background I went to the color panel,which allows me to edit the background color by clicking the thumbnails used the color picker. Then add layer mask to cut  parts out from Miwoo to blend in with the background. Adding many different kind of fonts was a little bit difficult because I need to find space to make it look appealing.</p>

          <a href="img/type.jpg">
            <img src="img/type.jpg" alt="">
            <p>I had to describe myself by using different types of fonts. The type of tool I used to create my flowers was the pen tool, it helped me create straight lines and curves by the two anchor points. As for my leafs, I clicked on the words and convert them to shape then I pressed  edit and clicked on Warp. So I was able to make my fonts shape like leafs. The words describe how I enjoy life, learning, or how I am still developing to become a professional web designer.<br><br></p>

            <img src="img/donat.jpg" alt="">
            <p>   As you can see, I created a good looking donut poster for my school called Thomas Edison. I used the elliptical marquee tool to helped me created a huge circle in the middle of the document. Then I used the subtraction selection tool to make a smaller circle in the middle which created my donut hole. After that I saved my selection and I used the subtraction tool again to created a bite mark in my yummy donut.<br><br> </p>

            <img src="img/shoes.jpg" alt="">
            <p> This is  I add pattern and tried to make it symmetrical as possible. I also edit the photo in only non-destructive way. To make it look more appealing I added clipping mask and  blending mode (multiply) to make the image fit perfectly in the shoes. The most challenging part was to make them all even.</p>

            <p> In class, we pretended Victor Cruz has approached to Thomas Edison and our job is to create his newest and greatest sneakers. The color I have chosen is unique and shows how cool and relax you are. This time I used the magic wand to add color. Then I used many layers in case I change my mind on the type of color I used. Using the magic wand tool is so helpful, it help me choose exactly the type of size to color in. I usually used solid and pattern colors and I'm happy how it turned out.This was my second time creating a new sneaker design.<br><br></p>

            <p> My newest creation I made so far is Mr. Potato Head! To attached all the fruits and vegetable to make a nice looking face in front of his face, I had to use different kind of tools. I had to used the marquee tool, lasso tools, and quick mask tools to be able to cut out all the elements. Also my fruits and vegetable aren't squish because I went to the application bar and  used free transformation to shifts the images.My funny looking potato head is complete!<br><br> </p>
